## Research Theme: A computational biology lab focused on understanding various contexts at single-cell resolution, including both data analysis and method development
<img src="assets/img/theme.gif">
Single-cell technology enables people to distinguish the heterogeneous signals from a biological sample. 
Accordingly, many single-cell-based methods and data have been generated. 
Currently, it is quite demanding for researchers to analyze this big data to extract a hidden feature that cannot be detected by single dataset.
Especially, we are interested in understanding cancer field but also interested in other immunological diseases.
We are trying to establish a hidden feature with big "pan-cancer" data.

## Approach
- Single-cell RNA, TCR/BCR, ATAC, Spatial, Perturb-seq <br/>
- Cancer & Immunology <br/>
- Mulit-modal integration <br/>
- AI-based method development or analysis (GAN, LLM-based) <br/>
